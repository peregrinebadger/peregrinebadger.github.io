# What you really need to start a company.

I occasionally meet founders who are excited by the idea of starting a company, but aren’t deeply committed to solving the problem they’ve selected.
\
\
You can spend months working on the company when you aren’t deeply committed. You tell yourself that the commitment can be willed into being, and anyone can decide to feel a certain way if you just push hard enough. You hope that after the next milestone, things will get easier. You hope that you’ll feel differently about the work required. That by gritting your teeth and forging ahead for a few more weeks or months, you’ll make it.
\
\
You won’t.
\
\
To successfully overcome the challenges in a startup, you need\:
  - A deeply emotional, unyielding commitment to solve a problem
  - The ability to do painfully vulnerable self-assessments to know if you’re the one to solve it.

This commitment flows from a well that lies deep within someone’s character. This well is created when formational experiences happen over years.
\
\
The experiences can be as joyous as growing up surfing on a pristine beach, or as terrifying as seeing a loved one die. They can be as isolating as growing up in a city where you’re an alien on a new planet, or as disruptive as moving countries every five years. They can be as simple as listening to a close friend complain about filing taxes.
\
\
For the people who learn from these experiences and thrive, they create in the person something special: a deep, emotional connection to a problem or space that drives them forward.
\
\
The hard part is being patient and honest enough to keep looking until you find your special connection.

## Finding A Problem
To find your problem area, figure out what you love to do and what change you want to create. Ask your mentors what they thought you’d end up doing when you first met. Ask them what you enjoyed most in high school and undergrad. Ask people you’re close to what they associate with you. Ask them what you really care about. Ask them for the one-liner they use to describe you.
\
\
Ask yourself why you chose your major and your past jobs. And ask yourself what values you want to bring into the world, or teach your kids about. Ask yourself what you want people to say at your funeral.
\
\
It could be there’s not a specific problem that comes into focus. If curing lung cancer was your life’s work, you’d probably know it. But patterns will emerge, and you can begin to figure out what sort of mission you find deeply meaningful.

\
Cast a wide net. When the [Cobalt Robotics](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cobaltrobotics/) founders started out, they spent months interviewing people across a variety of industries, asking about pain points and existing solutions, before they stumbled onto something they both love: building robots to solve problems for people. Security was almost incidental at the time, but it provided a path to more general-purpose robots that inspired us all as an early team.
\
\
Vulnerable interviews can also create a deep emotional connection to solving a problem. When the [Cocoon](https://www.linkedin.com/company/meetcocoon/)  founders started out, they didn’t have a deep connection to parental leave. At the time, none of the founders had any children. What they did have was a personal connection to nearing motherhood and an emotional openness to new ideas. When a friend shared the emotional distress of trying to take leave “Filing for maternity leave on my laptop while getting wheeled into a C-section” the founders were inspired to build software to make the experience better.   
\
Finding ideas that resonate with you takes time. It can be lonely to do alone, and too constrained with a potential cofounder. Often the best setups are informal get-togethers where people share what they’re exploring, without trying to impress anyone. [Calvin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/calvinfo/) is running one of these get-togethers in NYC right now.
\
\
Being a founder is like “chewing glass and staring into the abyss”[0], but with the right emotional connection to solving a problem, the glass is nourishing, and the abyss sparkles.
