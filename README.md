# What you really need to start a company.
 
I occasionally meet founders who are excited by the idea of starting a company, but aren’t deeply committed to solving the problem they’ve selected.
\
\
You can spend months working on the company when you aren’t deeply committed. You tell yourself that commitment comes with time or you “just have to push harder”. You hope that after the next milestone, things will get easier and you’ll feel differently about your work. That by gritting your teeth and forging ahead for a few more weeks or months, you’ll make it to the other side of the pain.
\
\
You won’t.
\
\
To successfully overcome the challenges in a startup, you need:
  - A deeply emotional, unyielding commitment to solve a problem
  - The ability to do painfully vulnerable self-assessments to know if you’re the one to solve it.
 
This commitment flows from a well that lies deep within someone’s character. This well is created when emotional formational experiences happen.
\
\
The experiences can be as joyous as growing up surfing on a pristine beach and falling in love with the natural world, or as terrifying as seeing a loved one die, and deciding to pursue a career treating diseases. They can be as simple as listening to a close friend complain about filing taxes.
\
\
These emotional connections to a problem or space drive people forward. The hard part is being patient and honest enough to keep looking until you find that special connection.
 
 
## Finding A Problem
 
This is often a year long journey of reflection and trial and error, but a few things that can speed it up are:
- Ask your mentors what they thought you’d end up doing when you first met
- Ask them what you enjoyed most in high school and undergrad
- Ask people you’re close to what they associate with you, and what you most care about.
- Ask them for the one-liner they use to describe you.
- Ask yourself why you chose your major and your past jobs
- Ask yourself what you want to bring into the world, or or what changes you want your kids to see when they grow up.
- Ask yourself what you want people to say at your funeral.


It could be there’s not a specific problem that comes into focus. If being a concert pianist  was your life’s work, you’d probably know it. But patterns will emerge, and you can begin to figure out what sort of mission you find deeply meaningful.

Cast a wide net. I worked at a security robot company called [Cobalt Robotics](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cobaltrobotics/). When the founders started out, they spent months interviewing people across a variety of industries, asking about pain points and existing solutions, before they stumbled onto something they both love: building robots to solve problems for people. Security was almost incidental at the time, but it provided a path to more general-purpose robots that inspired us all.
\
\
Interviews where you build a personal connection with the interviewee can also create a deep emotional connection to solving a problem. When my wife thought about starting [Cocoon](https://www.linkedin.com/company/meetcocoon/)  neither she nor her cofounders had a deep connection to parental leave. At the time, none of them had any children. What they did have was a personal connection to nearing motherhood and an emotional openness to new ideas. When a friend shared the emotional distress of trying to take leave “Filing for maternity leave on my laptop while getting wheeled into a C-section” they were inspired to build software to make the experience better.   
\
Finding ideas that resonate with you takes time. It can be lonely to do alone, and too constrained with a potential cofounder. Often the best setups are informal get-togethers where people share what they’re exploring, without trying to impress anyone.
\
\
Being a founder is like “chewing glass and staring into the abyss”[0], but with the right emotional connection to solving a problem, the glass is nourishing, and the abyss sparkles.
